Taqsh" Project â€“ Weather Info Web App

I built a simple weather web application that allows users to search for the weather of any city. The project was developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
I used Bootstrap to create a clean and responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes.
The app uses DOM Manipulation to dynamically display weather data based on user input, and it fetches real-time information via API Requests from a weather API.

This project helped me practice integrating design with real-time data and improve user interaction and responsiveness.
